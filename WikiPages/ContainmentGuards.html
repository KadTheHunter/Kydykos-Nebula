							<hr />
							<h2>Neurax Barracks Containment Guards</h2>
							<p>The Neurax Barracks Containment Guards were a sub-class of Containment Guards found at the Neurax Barracks, consisting mostly of Humans, and charged with containing the Neurax Clones and keeping them pacified, until further orders were received.</p>
							<p>NBCG Captains took orders directly from A. Neurax; In the aftermath of his disappearance, NBCG Captains unanimously agreed to continue enforcing his last orders: the containment of the Neurax Clones.</p>
							<hr />
							<h2>Multiverse Containment Guards</h2>
							<p>Multiverse Containment Guards is a broad group of Containment Guard Divisions, encompassing most notably the <em>Multiverse Maximum Security Prison Containment Guards</em>, the <em>Multiverse Phase Breach Containment Guards</em>, and the <em>Multiverse Biological Threat Containment Guards</em>, the latter two of which were created in response to the Containment Breaches at Neurax Barracks</p><br>
